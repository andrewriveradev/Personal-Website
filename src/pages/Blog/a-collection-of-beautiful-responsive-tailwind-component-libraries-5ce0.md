Since starting with Tailwind for my styling needs, my workflow has significantly improved since I follow the utility classes Tailwind provides me and everything ends up looking very elegant and clean for the amount of time I actually spend on it.

Some amazing developers have gone a step ahead and built entire component libraries based on the Tailwind classes. I have used a few of them and here's a list of are some of my favorites:

###[Windmill UI] (https://windmillui.com/)

I am slightly biased towards this one since this was the first library that I used on one of my [projects] (https://lift-next.vercel.app/).

####Pros:

- Includes a Pure HTML and a React Dashboard page right out of the box
- Dark Mode using React with a few lines of code
- Easy escape hatch in-case you wish to make some design changes
- Accessible out-of-the-box
- Absolutely free

#####Cons:

- I wish it had a catalog of larger everyday webpage components such as a header, navbar, footer, CTA templates to choose from.

###[Kutty] (https://kutty.netlify.app/)

I absolutely adore the Marketing components from Kutty and I have used a few for my personal website that I am working on right now.

####Pros:

- Includes plenty of webpage components like heroes, header, footers, blog list that are missing from Windmill UI
- Great support for Alpine and Vue JS
- Accessible out-of-the-box
- Absolutely free

#####Cons:

- Very minimal JS-free components and the JS dependant components are built with Alpine. So slightly difficult learning curve.

###[Tail-kit] (https://www.tailwind-kit.com/)

I have used bits and parts of this library for a few of the components. They offer over 250 free components and templates, based on Tailwind CSS 2.0. It's all compatible with React, VueJS, and Angular applications.

####Pros:

- Plenty of small and big webpage components. Most from the three that I have used thus far.
- They have some great templates for landing pages, error pages, and dashboards
- Accessible out-of-the-box
- Absolutely free

#####Cons:

- None, except that there's a slight learning curve given the huge amount of options.

I will make another post with more interesting libraries, if and when I get a chance to use them!
