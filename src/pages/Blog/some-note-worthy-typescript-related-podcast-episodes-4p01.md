After facing countless `cannot read property of undefined` errors and understanding the advantages as well as the downfalls of the dynamic nature of JavaScipt, I have finally jumped on the TypeScript bandwagon.

One of the first things I usually do before deciding to learn a new technology is to listen to some of my favorites tech podcasts and see what the community has to say. Here are a few of the podcast episodes that helped me understand the benefits of using TypeScipt, even before I wrote my first lime of TS code.

- **[Syntax - TypeScipt Fundamentals] (https://syntax.fm/show/324/typescript-fundamentals)** - Covers most of the TS fundamentals and the reasons for using it.

- **[Full Stack Radio - TypeScript and Testing](https://fullstackradio.com/144)** - An amazing episode about how TS makes your application robust while greatly reducing your need to write tests.

- **[TalkScript.FM - TypeScript At Scale](https://talkscript.sitepen.com/episode-57-typescript-at-scale/)** - An intriguing podcast episode from two experts about managing typescript projects at scale.

I will post about my learning journey with TypeScipt here and post some useful resources along the way.
